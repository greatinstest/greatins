Technologies and packages information:
I decided to use Laravel, because that's the framework you use in your company. I used Laravel 8.x, and I beleive that is the latest version.

Packages and components:
Bootstrap,
Awesome Fonts,
Carbon,
Laravel Google Calendar by Spatie
Server setup:
For testing on localhost, I am using Apache

I used Nginx settings when I deployed this project to Heroku

Google Calendar API:
I am using oauth to get API client credentials

I have created 'credentials' folder in root, and copied oauth JSONs there to avoid pushing Laravel's 'storage' folder to Heroku.

Test & Deploy:
Source code is available on Git

I decided to deply it here on Heroku, so you can test it right away.

The source code in repository, is exactly the same code which runs this Heroku app.
